Blinkenbox IoT Device 
---------------------

LEDs driven by an ESP8266 module with battery charge circuit. 

I used an Adafruit Huzzah (with an ESP8266-based ESP12E) to log onto a local hotspot at Portland Mini Maker Faire and create a webpage where you could change the color of the RGB LED by clicking on the buttons. You could select one of six preset colors directly, or you could adjust the red, green, or blue components separately.

It didnâ€™t hold up as well as I would have liked in broad daylight, but the diffused box (made by Stefan) was really nice.
